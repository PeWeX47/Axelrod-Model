# Implementation of Axelrod's Cultural Diffusion Model

Welcome to the repository for the implementation of Axelrod's cultural diffusion model! This project contains the source code and tools necessary to simulate the process of cultural diffusion in a society using the Axelrod model. The Axelrod model is a popular mathematical method used in social sciences to study the interaction among agents and the spread of culture.

## About the Axelrod Model

The Axelrod model, named after Robert Axelrod, is based on the assumption that agents in a society have certain cultural preferences and interact with other agents. In each simulation step, agents randomly select one of their neighbors and compare their preferences with those of the selected neighbor. If the preferences are similar, agents begin to share their cultures.
